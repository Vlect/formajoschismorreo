### Further Ideas:
- **Contextual Analysis**: If we have access to lyrics or genre data, we could refine these categories even further by considering lyrical content or the genre's typical emotional profile.
- **Machine Learning**: For even more sophisticated categorization, we could train a machine learning model on labeled data to predict the category based on more features like tempo, key, mode, and other audio features provided by Spotify.

# TO-DO:
- Improve evaluation of tracks (When a song can be defined as Happy, Sad, etc...)
- When creating a playlist, automatically make it public
